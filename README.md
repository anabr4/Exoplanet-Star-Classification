# Exoplanet-Star-Classification
In this project, we will analyse the flux data from thousands of stars via deep learning methods in order to classify them as either exoplanet-stars or non-exoplanet-stars. We will train several models on the training dataset in order to make predictions on the test dataset.

An exoplanet, or extrasolar planet, is the one that orbits a star outside our solar system. They give us information of the formation, composition, and diversity of planetary systems beyond the Solar system and they can vary in size, composition and orbital characteristics. Some of the types are terrestrial, super-earths, gas giants or neptune-like exoplanets.
